# Neural network for snake

This project is based on RL (**Reinforcement Learning**), in other words we are techinng a software agent (in this case our player) how to behave based on wo good it's doing.
We actually are going to reward the agent every time he is doing good. By doing this he will understand if he has done good actions.
**Deep Q learining**: approach that extends Reinforcement Learning by using deep neural networks to predict the actions.
